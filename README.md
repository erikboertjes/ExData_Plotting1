## Course project 1 - Data Science - Exploratory Data Analysis

This directory contains 4 R scripts:
* plot1.R
* plot2.R
* plot3.R
* plot4.R

In addition the directory contains the script
* getData.R

This script is used by each of the plot scripts to read data from the data directory.
The data itself is not part of this repository. Each plot script requires the file
_household\_power\_consumption.txt_ to be in the data directory.

Each plot script creates the corresponding plot from the assignment:
* plot1.png
* plot2.png
* plot3.png
* plot4.png

The data can be obtained from:

* <a href="https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/exdata%2Fdata%2Fhousehold_power_consumption.zip">Electric power consumption</a> [20Mb]

* <b>Description</b>: Measurements of electric power consumption in
one household with a one-minute sampling rate over a period of almost
4 years. Different electrical quantities and some sub-metering values
are available.
